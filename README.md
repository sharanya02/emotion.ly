# Emotion.ly

Be it a fun conversation or a boring presentation. We always wanted to know how others felt about our planned jokes or maybe even what others felt about the presentation which you have preparing and working on for days.  

Presenting to you Emotion.ly an AI based video-meet app which analyses the emotions of various participants during the conversation of the meeting and gives you the statistics you need, of the emotions of the overall group, as well as the individual members in that conversation
